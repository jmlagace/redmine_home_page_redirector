= Home Page Redirector plugin for Redmine

A very simple redmine plugin that will redirect signed-in users to My Page when they sign-in or when they click the home link in the website header.

Tested with Redmine 2.6.6 through 4.0.2 and ruby 2.1.x through 2.6.2

Install to redmine/plugins directory. No migrations are needed. No configuration needed 

== TODO 

- Write some simple test cases
